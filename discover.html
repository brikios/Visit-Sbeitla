                    Sbeitla is a small town in the central west region of Tunisia, 250km from Tunis. 
                    It is known for its remarkable Roman site and its Capitol, made up of not one but three temples,
                     dedicated to Minerva, Jupiter and Juno, the gods who protected Rome.

                    The western regions were incredibly prosperous in ancient times, 
                    and boast a wealth of treasures for amateur archaeologists. 
                    The site of Makthar, one of the largest in Tunisia, is home to some spectacular remains, like the Arch of Trajan, 
                    the Large Baths and the elegant colonnade of the School Juvenum. In Ha√Ødra, 
                    you can see the remains of one of the largest Byzantine fortresses in North Africa, as well as a number of Christian churches.
                     Indeed, the western regions boast extensive traces of ancient Christianity. 
                     In Sbeitla, the huge Basilica of Vitalis has a stunning basin for baptisms covered in mosaics.
                      In the countryside, the El Gousset archways are all that remain of a large church, 33 metres long, 
                    reminding us that Tunisia was once a key stronghold for Christians in the West.
